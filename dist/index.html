PROMPT
Create a simple note-taking app in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app should enable users to:
 Add notes
 Edit notes once created
 Delete notes
 Select a color for each note, from a fixed list of colors
You may use vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Do not use any CSS frameworks/libraries. Please only submit
code that is your own.
This question is expected to take 60-75 minutes to complete.

MY NOTES
If I were to spend additional time on this project, I'd like to style it a bit more.
 If note background is "dark", turn text white.
 Make it responsive by writing media queries for tablet and mobile.
 Stylize the interface
